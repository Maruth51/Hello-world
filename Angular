What is an Angular?
	Angular is a complete framework for web application development.
	Angular Extends HTML attributes with directives and binds data with HTML.
My Understanding:
I think the important file in an angular component is app.component.js.
App.component.js contains @component decorator.
 
@component(
	Selector: ‘app-hero-child’
		Which means wherever angular finds the Html tag <app-hero-child><app-hero-child> it renders the view(Html Template) of HeroChildComponent class.
	Template: “./index.html”
		Corresponding HTML page for component class

DataBinding:
{{}} => Interpolation
	Binds the data in Html from component
	Ex: 
		We have a variable declared in the class as name
		Export class app{
			name = “MAruth”}
	In HTML
		<p> {{name}}<p>
Myunderstanding:
	Whenever a variable is declared in component class. We can access that variable in the view using the interpolation{{}}
	Component when the template is rendered, the {{name}} is replaced with 'Maruth'.
